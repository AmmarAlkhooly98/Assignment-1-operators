# Assignment-1-operators
### This is a java assignment for the following problem: 

#### The first part (Part1.java) of the program reads an arithmetic operation when the user keys in one of the following forms as a string datatype:
		a + b; a - b;  a * b; a/b; -a - b; -a - -b; -a- -b; -a  --b; -a--b;

#### For second part (part2.java), this program reads two valid arithmetic operations. Assume the arithmetic operation sign for the purposes of the description to be of & (+, -, *, /). They can be in the form of:
	a  & b & c. Some examples are:
              a + b + c, 
              a -b*c, 
              a/b*c, 
              a*-b /c
              -a- -b*c
#### The classes and the rest of the description is exactly the same as in Part 1.
